There are those who believe that life here began out there... far across the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians or the Toltecs or the Mayans. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the heavens. Fleeing from the Cylon Tyranny, the last Battlestar - Galactica - leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest. A shining planet, known as Earth.

Once in every lifetime, comes a love like this. Oh I need you, you need me, oh my darling can't you see. Young Ones. Darling we're the Young Ones. Young Ones. Shouldn't be afraid. To live, love, there's a song to be sung. Cause we may not be the Young Ones very long.

Moon over Parma, bring my love to me tonight. Guide her to Cleveland, underneath your silvery light. We're going bowlin' so don't lose her in Solon. Moon over Parma, tonight!
