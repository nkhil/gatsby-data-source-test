Don't go to bed, with no price on your head. No, no, don't do it. Fon't do the crime, if you can't do the time, yeah, don't do it. And keep your eye on the sparrow, when the going gets narrow. Don't do it, don't do it. Where can I go where the cold winds don't blow, Now. Well, well, well.

Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, catches thieves just like flies, look out! Here comes the Spiderman. Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood. Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey there, there goes the Spiderman. In the chill of night at the scene of a crime, like a streak of light he arrives just in time! Spiderman, Spiderman, friendly neighborhood Spiderman. Wealth and fame, He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang up. Whenever there's a hang up, you'll find the Spiderman!

There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling transmission. We will control the horizontal, we will control the vertical. We can change the focus to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity. For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the Outer Limits.
